Viggo Mortensen said: "One of the best pieces of advice I ever got was from a horse master. 
He told me to go slow to go fast. I think that applies to everything in life.
We live as though there aren't enough hours in the day but if we do each thing calmly an
d carefully we will get it done quicker and with much less stress."
