https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/local/descriptions

Example
An initial request has to be made to web search endpoint with a given query. An example CURL request is given below.



curl -s --compressed "https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?q=greek+restaurants+in+san+francisco" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" \
  -H "X-Subscription-Token: <YOUR_API_KEY>"

If the query returns a list of locations, as in this case, each location result has an id field, which is a temporary ID that can be used to retrieve extra information about the location. An example from the locations result is given below.

{
  "locations": {
    "results": [
      {
        "id": "1520066f3f39496780c5931d9f7b26a6",
        "title": "Pangea Banquet Mediterranean Food"
      },
      {
        "id": "d00b153c719a427ea515f9eacf4853a2",
        "title": "Park Mediterranean Grill"
      },
      {
        "id": "4b943b378725432aa29f019def0f0154",
        "title": "The Halal Mediterranean Co."
      }
    ]
  }
}

The id value can be used to further fetch extra information about the location. An example request is given below.



curl -s --compressed "https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/local/pois?ids=1520066f3f39496780c5931d9f7b26a6&ids=d00b153c719a427ea515f9eacf4853a2" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" \
  -H "x-subscription-token: <YOUR_API_KEY>"

An AI generated description associated with a location can be further fetched using the example below.



curl -s --compressed "https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/local/descriptions?ids=1520066f3f39496780c5931d9f7b26a6&ids=d00b153c719a427ea515f9eacf4853a2" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" \
